# BW Shooter

BW Shooter is a simple 2D multiplayer game made with JavaSCript. There are two types of shooter in this game, (you guessed it), the black shooter and the white shooter.

As the sun rises, more white shooters will be hiding under the sunlight. And when the sun comes down, more black shooters will hide within the shadow.

You can move left, move right, jump and shoot at your opposing color.
